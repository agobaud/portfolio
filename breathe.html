		<div class="project-content">Business Communications was a course where we learned to write and present in a business setting. From learning how to write cover letters to presenting 30 second elevator pitches, Business Communications was a very applicable semester-long class.</div>
		<div class="project-content">The second half of the semester was focused on our group project where we developed the idea for a company and put together a marketing proposal and presentation, a veture capital proposal, and venture capital presentation. As a team of 5, we took on different roles such as President, Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Marketing, Vice President of Finance, and Vice President of Development.</div>

			<div class="aboutme-content">I am a 23 year old currently living in New York City with a passion for technology and design. After graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2012 with a degree in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction, I began working with Deutsche Bank first as a User Experience Analyst, and currently as a Business Analyst.</div>

I am currently looking for a full time position using not only the skills I learned at Carnegie Mellon, but also using the skills I picked up while working at an investment bank for the past year.</div>
		    <div class="aboutme-content">In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, pretending to be a distance runner, hosting garden parties, and exploring all that New York has to offer.</div>
