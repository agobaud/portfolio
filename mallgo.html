			Through our research, we learned about what shoppers are looking for when they decide to physically go to a mall to shop versus shopping online. We learned more about the nuances of shopping with friends and asking for friends’ opinions.

			From this, we developed MallGo.com, a way for friends to shop together in a mall setting while they were shopping online.

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">I am a 23 year old currently living in New York City with a passion for technology and design. After graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2012 with a degree in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction, I began working with Deutsche Bank first as a User Experience Analyst, and currently as a Business Analyst.
		    		<br /><br />
		    	While I’ve learned a lot from working in the financial industry, I am ready to get back to what I am most interested in: user experience and interaction design. I am currently looking for a full time position using not only the skills I learned at Carnegie Mellon, but also using the skills I picked up while working at an investment bank for the past year.
		    		<br /><br />
				In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, pretending to be a distance runner, hosting garden parties, and exploring all that New York has to offer.</div>
