					<p>Our goal for this project was to design a web experience that reconciles  both the digital and analog worlds of shopping by facilitating social interaction among friends.</p>
				
					<p>Through our research, we learned about what shoppers are looking for when they decide to physically go to a mall to shop versus shopping online. We learned more about the nuances of shopping with friends and asking for friends’ opinions.</p>
				
					<p>From this, we developed MallGo.com, a way for friends to shop together in a mall setting while they were shopping online.</p>

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">I have always worked on things to improve people's lives - from volunteering with <a href="http://www.cnhkeyclub.org/">Key Club</a> in high school to working on improving financial software interfaces today, I enjoy helping people and being involved. While at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I learned how to use my love of computers and technology to make people's lives easier through user experience design. I learned how to create designs based on user research, and am now able to craft experiences that meet the ultimate goal of users. Between my involvement in <a href="http://www.imentor.org/">various</a> <a href="http://alumni.cmu.edu/s/1410/alumni/index.aspx?sid=1410&gid=1&pgid=443">organizations</a> here in New York and studying <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, I have found my passion in creating experiences for people, be it through planning vacations with friends, planning <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/new-york-city">Startup Weekend</a> events, or improving the user experience of financial software. </div>
