			This project focused on the research phase and the synthesis of our research to create a concept to meet our findings. We synthesized 3 key research findings, and  from there, developed our design opportunity. This project was created to focus on how technolgoy can be designed to be a maintenance agent. Most of the project  timeline was spent on background research, and the presentation of the idea in a final video sketch.

		<div class="project-content">VAUS is an intelligent agent designed for University students living together in apartments or houses. Since students are often too busy with academics, extra curricular activities, and social lives to keep up with the maintenance of their living spaces, we knew our agent had a perfect place in the lives of university students.</div>

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">I have always worked on things to improve people's lives - from volunteering with <a href="http://www.cnhkeyclub.org/">Key Club</a> in high school to working on improving financial software interfaces today, I enjoy helping people and being involved. While at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I learned how to use my love of computers and technology to make people's lives easier through user experience design. I learned how to create designs based on user research, and am now able to craft experiences that meet the ultimate goal of users. Between my involvement in <a href="http://www.imentor.org/">various</a> <a href="http://alumni.cmu.edu/s/1410/alumni/index.aspx?sid=1410&gid=1&pgid=443">organizations</a> here in New York and studying <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, I have found my passion in creating experiences for people, be it through planning vacations with friends, planning <a href="http://www.nycsw.co">Startup Weekend</a> events, or improving the user experience of financial software. </div>
