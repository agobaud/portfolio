			<div class="header-line"></div>
			<div class="project-content">The Smart Energy Visualization project was a collaborative project between Bosch Research and the Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Human-Computer Interaction department. </div>
			<div class="project-content">Through our research, we discovered what was most relevant to users’ energy consumption. From there, we sought to create an actionable interface that increases energy awareness for users and built our skill sets in user research, data visualization, and overall interface usability. We determined a target population of interest and created an information display meant to influence the users’ behavior related to energy conservation. </div>
			<div class="project-content">Our project goal was to make use of Bosch’s non-intrusive load monitoring sensors to provide bill-payers with actionable information on their energy usage. We initially focused on home owners, landlords and facility managers, however based on the results of our user research, we narrowed our audience to home owners. </div>
			<div class="project-content">We gathered information to evaluate the incentives users desire through interviews and discovered what information is most actionable, leading to a refined specificity of the information they require. This guided our design of Smart Energy.</div>
			<div class="project-content-header">The Solution</div>
			<div class="header-line"></div>
			<div class="project-content">Smart Energy is a desktop and mobile website designed to allow users to view their energy usage throughout their home, and encourage users to minimize their energy usage. With various visualizations comparing energy usage on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, users could see not only how much total energy they were using, butalso how much energy each appliance was using. If an appliance was using an abnormally large amount of energy,the user would be notified to check on the status of that appliance, in case it was broken.</div>
			<div class="project-content">More information about the project, our research, and our solution can be found here in our Final Report.</div>

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">I have always worked on things to improve people's lives - from volunteering with <a href="http://www.cnhkeyclub.org/">Key Club</a> in high school to working on improving financial software interfaces today, I enjoy helping people and being involved. While at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I learned how to use my love of computers and technology to make people's lives easier through user experience design. I learned how to create designs based on user research, and am now able to craft experiences that meet the ultimate goal of users. <br /><br />Between my involvement in <a href="http://www.imentor.org/">various</a> <a href="http://alumni.cmu.edu/s/1410/alumni/index.aspx?sid=1410&gid=1&pgid=443">organizations</a> here in New York and studying <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, I have found my passion in creating experiences for people, be it through planning vacations with friends, planning <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/new-york-city">Startup Weekend</a> events, or improving the user experience of financial software. </div>
