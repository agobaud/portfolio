			Every spring semester, the Undergraduate Students of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University take their final HCI Capstone Project Course where they work with a client in the Pittsburgh community on a semester long project to use all the skills they have learned in their undergraduate careers.

			<div class="header-line"></div>
			<div class="project-content">The Smart Energy Visualization project was a collaborative project between Bosch Research and the Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Human-Computer Interaction department. </div>
			<div class="project-content">Through our research, we discovered what was most relevant to users’ energy consumption. From there, we sought to create an actionable interface that increases energy awareness for users and built our skill sets in user research, data visualization, and overall interface usability. We determined a target population of interest and created an information display meant to influence the users’ behavior related to energy conservation. </div>
			<div class="project-content">Our project goal was to make use of Bosch’s non-intrusive load monitoring sensors to provide bill-payers with actionable information on their energy usage. We initially focused on home owners, landlords and facility managers, however based on the results of our user research, we narrowed our audience to home owners. </div>
			<div class="project-content">We gathered information to evaluate the incentives users desire through interviews and discovered what information is most actionable, leading to a refined specificity of the information they require. This guided our design of Smart Energy.</div>
			<div class="project-content-header">The Solution</div>
			<div class="header-line"></div>
			<div class="project-content">Smart Energy is a desktop and mobile website designed to allow users to view their energy usage throughout their home, and encourage users to minimize their energy usage. With various visualizations comparing energy usage on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, users could see not only how much total energy they were using, butalso how much energy each appliance was using. If an appliance was using an abnormally large amount of energy,the user would be notified to check on the status of that appliance, in case it was broken.</div>
			<div class="project-content">More information about the project, our research, and our solution can be found here in our Final Report.</div>

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">I am a 23 year old currently living in New York City with a passion for technology and design. After graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2012 with a degree in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction, I began working with Deutsche Bank first as a User Experience Analyst, and currently as a Business Analyst.
		    		<br /><br />
		    	While I’ve learned a lot from working in the financial industry, I am ready to get back to what I am most interested in: user experience and interaction design. I am currently looking for a full time position using not only the skills I learned at Carnegie Mellon, but also using the skills I picked up while working at an investment bank for the past year.
		    		<br /><br />
				In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, pretending to be a distance runner, hosting garden parties, and exploring all that New York has to offer.</div>
