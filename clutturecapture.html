					This project focused on the research phase and the synthesis of our research to create a concept to meet our findings. We synthesized 3 key research findings, and  from there, developed our design opportunity. This project was created to focus on how technolgoy can be designed to be a maintenance agent. Most of the project  timeline was spent on background research, and the presentation of the idea in a final video sketch.

				<div class="header-line"></div>
				<div class="project-content">Change is inevitable. For parents, sometimes the hardest change is watching their children grow up, move out, and begin independent lives. And with this change comes a challenge; surviving the “empty nest”—a house once populated with children and now deserted of all but their leftover belongings.</div>
				<div class="project-content">Determining which belongings to keep as sentimental reminders of childhood and which items to throw or give away poses a challenge for both the children and their parents; both parties live independent lives, keep different schedules and timelines, and vary in their availability. Since children and their parents cannot always be in the same place at the same time, having a way to communicate about the child’s belongings from afar is crucial to this decision process.</div>
				<div class="project-content-header">Our Solution</div>
				<div class="header-line"></div>
				<div class="project-content">The application consists of two interfaces: one for the parent, and one for the children. The parent signs up for the application by entering the email addresses of her children and signs them up. Through this action, the children are linked to the parent, so that the parent’s application can communicate to the child’s. Upon opening the application, the user (parent or child) logs in with their username and password and is taken to the homepage.</div>
				<div class="project-content">There are different home pages for the parents and children, since each of them has different capabilities within the application. The parent's interface allows the user to take a photo of an object, add an optional description to the object, and send the picture to the corresponding child. The parent receives updates as the children make decisions about objects. The parent is able to view all of the photos or view groups of photos broken down by child. A red notification bubble appears next to the name of the child when a child makes a decision about an item.</div>

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">I am a 23 year old currently living in New York City with a passion for technology and design. After graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2012 with a degree in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction, I began working with Deutsche Bank first as a User Experience Analyst, and currently as a Business Analyst.
		    		<br /><br />
		    	While I’ve learned a lot from working in the financial industry, I am ready to get back to what I am most interested in: user experience and interaction design. I am currently looking for a full time position using not only the skills I learned at Carnegie Mellon, but also using the skills I picked up while working at an investment bank for the past year.
		    		<br /><br />
				In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, pretending to be a distance runner, hosting garden parties, and exploring all that New York has to offer.</div>
