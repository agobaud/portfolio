					This project focused on the research phase and the synthesis of our research to create a concept to meet our findings. We synthesized 3 key research findings, and  from there, developed our design opportunity. This project was created to focus on how technolgoy can be designed to be a maintenance agent. Most of the project  timeline was spent on background research, and the presentation of the idea in a final video sketch.

				<div class="header-line"></div>
				<div class="project-content">Change is inevitable. For parents, sometimes the hardest change is watching their children grow up, move out, and begin independent lives. And with this change comes a challenge; surviving the “empty nest”—a house once populated with children and now deserted of all but their leftover belongings.</div>
				<div class="project-content">Determining which belongings to keep as sentimental reminders of childhood and which items to throw or give away poses a challenge for both the children and their parents; both parties live independent lives, keep different schedules and timelines, and vary in their availability. Since children and their parents cannot always be in the same place at the same time, having a way to communicate about the child’s belongings from afar is crucial to this decision process.</div>
				<div class="project-content-header">Our Solution</div>
				<div class="header-line"></div>
				<div class="project-content">The application consists of two interfaces: one for the parent, and one for the children. The parent signs up for the application by entering the email addresses of her children and signs them up. Through this action, the children are linked to the parent, so that the parent’s application can communicate to the child’s. Upon opening the application, the user (parent or child) logs in with their username and password and is taken to the homepage.</div>
				<div class="project-content">There are different home pages for the parents and children, since each of them has different capabilities within the application. The parent's interface allows the user to take a photo of an object, add an optional description to the object, and send the picture to the corresponding child. The parent receives updates as the children make decisions about objects. The parent is able to view all of the photos or view groups of photos broken down by child. A red notification bubble appears next to the name of the child when a child makes a decision about an item.</div>

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">I have always worked on things to improve people's lives - from volunteering with <a href="http://www.cnhkeyclub.org/">Key Club</a> in high school to working on improving financial software interfaces today, I enjoy helping people and being involved. While at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I learned how to use my love of computers and technology to make people's lives easier through user experience design. I learned how to create designs based on user research, and am now able to craft experiences that meet the ultimate goal of users. Between my involvement in <a href="http://www.imentor.org/">various</a> <a href="http://alumni.cmu.edu/s/1410/alumni/index.aspx?sid=1410&gid=1&pgid=443">organizations</a> here in New York and studying <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, I have found my passion in creating experiences for people, be it through planning vacations with friends, planning <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/new-york-city">Startup Weekend</a> events, or improving the user experience of financial software. </div>
