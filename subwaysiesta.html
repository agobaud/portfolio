			<em>Develop an application for mobile workers who use mass transit to commute to multiple job sites.</em>
			<p>We spent time thinking about different problems New Yorkers face with their daily commute on the  subway, and thought about the different ways New Yorkers like to spend their time during their routine commutes. We realized that commuters try to spend their time in the subway as efficnetly as possible, by reading, listening to music, sleeping, etc. Very rarely do we see New Yorkers doing nothing on long subway rides.</p>
	
			<p>This led to the birth of Subway Siesta. We know that people riding public transportation in New York City need to pay attention to upcoming stops so they do not miss their destination. Frequent users of public transportation would like to use their travel time productively - Subway Siesta allows users to do just that.</p>

		<div class="project-content">Knowing this, we came up with our hunt statement for the project:</div>
		<div class="project-content"><em>People who ride public transportation in New York City need to pay attention to upcoming stops so that they do not miss their destination. Frequent users of public transportation would like to use their travel time productively.</em></div>
		<div class="project-images"><img src="img/subwaysiesta1.png" width="60%"></div>
		<div class="project-content">We began to storyboard how users would complete essential tasks in our mobile app. Here, we show how a user would select the tranfers they choose to take.</div>
		<div class="project-images"><img src="img/subwaysiesta2.png" width="60%"></div>
		<div class="project-content">We then went on to create basic wireframes to show what the app would look like while the user was in the middle of their journey.</div>
		<div class="project-content">This project also had us focus on creating a solid persona to work with during our design process. Meet Rachel Wells, our 27 year old designer living in New York City. </div>

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">When I first applied to college, I thought I was going to be a programmer and do something cool like build video games. That idea quickly went out the window after I took my first programming class – clearly programming was not for me.</div>

		    	<div class="aboutme-content">Instead, I went on to study human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University and now work as a designer at an investment bank. When I am not beautifying and improving financial software, I work on organizing events with Startup Weekend NYC, run social media and plan events for the NYC Metro Carnegie Mellon Alumni Group, and pretend to be a long distance runner. I love working on things that make people’s lives better either through good design or good logistical planning.</div>
